Software to pull version numbers from websites of pipeline tools and make predictions when new versions will appear. With this information one can plan maintenance on pipeline tooling.

This tool will continuously scan websites or known end points for version numbers of pipeline software. The results are presented on a website but most importantly, they will be send as notifications to end points that users can setup. With these end points users can automate roll out of new versions to their own test environments. This will decrease time spend in life cycle management of pipeline tools. This also makes it possible to focus on a lot of small changes and rolling out each new version of any tool.
